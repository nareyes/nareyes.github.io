My name is Nick, and I'm a learning enthusiast. I wasn't always this way. I struggled with learning for most of my life, but that started to change in 2016. Buckle up, kids... This is a
not-so-exciting story about a guy that learned how to learn and became obsessed.

A little backstory; After graduating high school, I went straight to work in the construction industry, working my way up to a project manager and licensed contractor. Somewhere along the way, I 
decided to simultaneously open and operate a business. That was fun. Not really, but it was filled with valuable life lessons that I can't put a price on. Regardless, I was generally unhappy and 
lost in the career aspect of my life. That all changed in 2016 when my wife and I decided to move to Minnesota with no career prospects or any idea as to what I was going to do with my life. It 
was a classic burn the ships moment. I decided it was going to be my reinvention, and getting a degree became my biggest priority.

I decided to pursue a BS in Economics with ASU. As soon as I started, I was taken back to my high school days, where I was terrible in school and always struggled to learn. I always chalked it 
up to having a bad memory, a bad teacher, or whatever excuse I could think of. I knew I had to approach this differently, so I hit Google.

I started researching cognitive science, more specifically, how we learn and retain information. I researched the web, read books, watched YouTube videos, performed the African memory dance (oh 
yea, I happened to be in Africa at the time). I was desperate! It took some time to find strategies that worked for me, but finally, I came across Make It Stick: The Science of Successful 
Learning by Peter Brown. It was the first development book I read multiple times, highlighted, took notes, and generally loved. Something incredible happened after I read this book; School 
became easier, reading became easier, my learning confidence soared, and I oddly started to enjoy the process of learning.

Fast forward 5ish years to today. I work as a business consultant and a self-described data analyst. What does that mean exactly? Well, my official title is Business Consultant, but I love to 
leverage data in my role. I've taken it upon myself to explore data science and implement various analysis tools and languages in my work, like Power BI and R Studio. Anywho, I digress. I'm 
about a year from graduating with my BS and have plans to pursue an MS in Statistics or Data Science so I can officially transition to the wonderful world of data science.

Throughout this journey, I've applied the strategies I've learned along the way to excel in school and do an immense amount of development. I've read countless books and actually recall what 
I've learned, taken courses, certifications, and learned from peers. Which brings me to the purpose of creating this blog, to share the various things I learn in an easily digestible format. Why 
is this different than any of the other book summary blogs out there? I don't know, and I don't care, to be honest. I love to learn new things and enjoy doing this, so I want to share it with 
you. Selfishly, writing helps solidify the learning process and is a skill I want to develop, so it's a win-win. I hope that readers who stumble across this blog can learn a thing or two and 
share takeaways and input so we can all Get Learnt together.

So, what can you expect? I love to read about data, business, economics, personal development, and cognitive science. You can expect summaries for books and courses that pertain to these topics 
and maybe some random books here and there. I also expect to post more about my learning experience thus far and share random thoughts or learnings I may have. I hope you enjoy my posts and find 
value in reading them. I'd love to engage in conversation with you all, so please comment!
